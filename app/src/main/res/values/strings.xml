Change in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered teams.</li><li>Violation of any the above rules will lead to disqualification.</li></ul><p><strong>Criteria for Triumph : </strong></p><ul><li>A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized or out of the arena.</li><li>A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least one inch in a timed period of 30 seconds.A bot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement.</li><li>If both robots survive the five minutes at that point, the robot with the higher hit points wins.</li></ul><p><strong>Safety Rules : </strong></p><ul><li>Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing.</li><li>If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguousor borderline, please contact the event organizers.</li><li>All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges.</li></ul><p><strong>Problem statement : </strong>Design and construct a remote or wired controlled robot capable of fighting a one on one tournament.</p><p><strong>Dimensions and Fabrications : </strong></p><ul><li>The bot should fit in a box of dimension 1.7ft * 1.7ft * 1.7ft (l x b x h) with all mechanisms fully executing motions. Length and width is measured to the extremities of the Robot, i.e. includes any overhanging bodywork, weaponry or protrusions. The external device used to control the bot is not included in the size constraint.</li></ul><p><strong>Mobility : </strong>All bots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete. Methods of mobility include :</p><ul><li>Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot).</li><li>Jumping and hopping is allowed to an extent of 1/2ft.</li><li>Flying (using airfoil, helium balloons, ornithopters, etc.) is not allowed.</li></ul><p><strong>Robot Control Requirements : </strong></p><ul><li>If the bot is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of the bot should be stacked as a single unit. The wires should be properly insulated. Teams are suggested to use only rated wires such as ISI marked. Loose connections or improper wiring may lead to direct disqualification even before the event.</li><li>If the bot is controlled wirelessly, the bot must at least have a four frequency remote control circuit or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of the race to avoid frequency interference with other teams. The case of any interference in the wireless systems will not be considered for rematch or results.</li><li>Remote control systems from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used.</li></ul><p><strong>Battery and Power : </strong></p><ul><li>The machine can be powered electrically only. Batteries must be sealed, immobilized electrolyte types (such as Li-ion, NiCd,NiMH or dry cells).</li><li>Working voltages must not exceed 24V DC (mean voltage) at any point of time.</li><li>All power connections must be of an adequate grade and adequately insulated. Cables must be routed to minimize the chances of being cut.</li><li>All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct disqualification.</li><li>Battery Eliminators are allowed and power source would be available at the venue for the eliminators. Motors: The robot should move as fast as possible around the arena with the help of motors.</li><li>DC motors and stepper motors (12V-24V) can be used as per the design of bots.</li></ul>]]></string>
